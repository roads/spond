    Arguments:
        n_concept: A scalar indicating the number of concepts.
        noise (optional): A scalar indicating the amount of noise to
            add. This should be between 0 and 1.

        seed (optional): A scalar indicating the seed to use in the

    Returns:
        z_0: The first embedding.
        z_1: The second embedding.
